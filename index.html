                I want to become a frontend developer by learning as many
                technologies as possible that can be used in various projects.
                Create really convenient and beautiful projects that people will
                use. In the future, I also want to study the backend in order to
                be a full-fledged fullstack developer.

                My last project was a small ToDo list, written, in fact, only in
                JavaScript and CSS.

                I have no experience in commercial development. There are only a
                few projects that I wrote as a training of my skills.

                I have a higher non-core education (bachelor’s and master’s
                degree in SPCPU, chemical technology). I studied the JavaRush
                course, materials at learn.javascript, video courses by Vladilen
                Minin, and much more.

                (gathered teams of English-speaking people and coordinated
                actions to achieve results).
