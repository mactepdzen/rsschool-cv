3. I want to become a frontend developer by learning as many technologies as possible that can be used in various projects. Create really convenient and beautiful projects that people will use. In the future, I also want to study the backend in order to be a full-fledged fullstack developer.

5. My last project was a small ToDo list, written, in fact, only in JavaScript and CSS.
